Learn how to utilize the [Swift Package Catalog](https://packagecatalog.com)
and the [Swift Sandbox](https://swift.sandbox.bluemix.net) to accelerate your
Swift development with ease.

> NOTE: This tutorial takes less than 5 minutes to complete.

## Swift Package Catalog

In this section you will become familiar with the main features of the IBM Swift
Package Catalog, and how they can augment your Swift development experience.

For the remainder of this section please navigate to
[Swift Package Catalog](https://packagecatalog.com) in a browser.

#### Search for a Swift package

#### Submit a new Swift package

#### View a Swift package's dependencies

> NOTE: If you would like to keep a list of your favorite Swift packages,
> or subscribe to notifications for particular packages, go ahead and
> `Login/Sign Up` so that the catalog can persist your favorites and
> subscriptions when you click the heart next to a package for example.

## Swift Sandbox

In this section we build on the Swift Package Catalog experience and discover
the IBM Swift Sandbox environment where you can try out Swift server samples,
or craft entirely new snippets of Swift code rapidly, in a safe environment.

#### Try out a Swift sample in the Sandbox

Back in your Swift Package Catalog browser tab either navigate to the
IBM-Swift/SwiftyJSON package, or just click here
[SwiftyJSON](https://packagecatalog.com/package/IBM-Swift/SwiftyJSON)

You will notice that this particular package has a new button near the
`View on GitHub` button that looks like this:

<img
  alt="Try in Sandbox"

/>

When a Swift package in the Swift Package Catalog has this button it means the
package owner has provided samples to try out the package code in the Swift
Sandbox. Go ahead and click `Try in Sandbox` for IBM-Swift/SwiftyJSON and
you will be redirected to Swift Sandbox.

#### Modify the Swift sample

#### Share your modified Swift sample
