## Section 1: IBM Swift Package Catalog

In this section you will become familiar with the main features of the IBM Swift
Package Catalog, and how they can augment your Swift development experience.

### Search for packages

Searching for community Swift packages is one of the main value adds provided
by the IBM Swift Package Catalog. Swift packages are mildly categorized, but
we support fuzzy search on package names as well.

Please open [Swift Package Catalog](https://packagecatalog.com) in a new tab.

In the search bar that is on the landing page, enter a package or a category
you are looking for:

> Hint: If you aren't sure what you are looking for, try `json`.

/>

> Note: After filling in the search bar, hitting `Enter` or clicking
> `See All Results for "json"`  will bring you to a comprehensive search page
> with more results.

#### Checkpoint

Search for, navigate to, and view the READMEs for each of the following packages:
- IBM-Swift/Kitura

### View package dependents

Being able to easily view the Swift packages that depend on a specific Swift package
gives some valuable insight into the community view of that package. This is
easy to view with the IBM Swift Package Catalog.

While viewing the READMEs from the previous [Checkpoint](#checkpoint-1), off to
the right there is a panel of information about each of the packages:

  width="300"

/>

By arrowing down on the `Dependents` field for each, you can view the dependents.
Likewise, if you are interested in the `Dependencies` of a given package.

#### Checkpoint

View the dependents for the following packages:
- IBM-Swift/Kitura

### Submit a package

We try our best to populate our Swift package index on a regular basis as new
packages are released, but we are only humans. If you know about Swift packages
that you can't find while searching the IBM Swift Package Catalog then please
help us out. Its easy, all you need is a public GitHub repo.

From any page in the catalog, click the `Submit a Package` in the navigation bar.

/>

Then simply submit the url associated with the package's GitHub repository.

/>

> Note: It can take a few moments before our backend processes your submission.
> If you don't see the package appear in the catalog within an hour, something
> likely didn't work. Check that the url you submitted is accurate, and the
> repository is public.

## Section 2: IBM Swift Sandbox

In this section we build on the Swift Package Catalog experience and discover
the IBM Swift Sandbox environment where you can try out Swift server samples,
or craft entirely new snippets of Swift code rapidly, in a safe environment.

### Try out a sample

Back in your Swift Package Catalog browser tab either navigate to the
IBM-Swift/SwiftyJSON package, or just click here
[SwiftyJSON](https://packagecatalog.com/package/IBM-Swift/SwiftyJSON)

You will notice that this particular package has a new button near the
`View on GitHub` button that looks like this:

<img
  alt="Try in Sandbox"
  width="250"
  src="static/package-menu-try-selected.png"
/>

When a Swift package in the Swift Package Catalog has this button it means the
package owner has provided samples to try out the package code in the Swift
Sandbox. Go ahead and click `Try in Sandbox` for IBM-Swift/SwiftyJSON and
select one of the registered samples that appear:

<img
  alt="Choose Swift sample"
  width="500"
  src="static/choose-sample.png"
/>

Once you are redirected to the IBM Swift Sandbox, run the sample as is:

<img

/>

### Create a snippet

TODO: Steps for making a simple yet noticeable change to the sample.

### Share your snippet

TODO: Steps for sharing the modified sample.

## Section 3: Exercises

### Login or sign up

If you would like to keep a list of your favorite Swift packages,
or subscribe to notifications for particular packages, go ahead and
`Login/Sign Up` so that the catalog can persist your favorites and
subscriptions when you click the heart next to a package for example.

TODO: Add screen shots.

### Favorite a package
