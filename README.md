## Section 2: IBM Swift Sandbox

In this section we build on the Swift Package Catalog experience and discover
the IBM Swift Sandbox environment where you can try out Swift server samples,
or craft entirely new snippets of Swift code rapidly, in a safe environment.

#### Try out a sample

Back in your Swift Package Catalog browser tab either navigate to the
IBM-Swift/SwiftyJSON package, or just click here
[SwiftyJSON](https://packagecatalog.com/package/IBM-Swift/SwiftyJSON)

You will notice that this particular package has a new button near the
`View on GitHub` button that looks like this:

<img
  alt="Try in Sandbox"
  width="250"
  src="static/package-menu-try-selected.png"
/>

When a Swift package in the Swift Package Catalog has this button it means the
package owner has provided samples to try out the package code in the Swift
Sandbox. Go ahead and click `Try in Sandbox` for IBM-Swift/SwiftyJSON and
select one of the registered samples that appear:

/>

 TODO: Steps for executing the sample as is.

#### Create a snippet

TODO: Steps for making a simple yet noticeable change to the sample.

#### Share your snippet

TODO: Steps for sharing the modified sample.
